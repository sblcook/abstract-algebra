\section{Section 3.3 \#8}
\paragraph{Problem}
Let $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ be as in Exercise 39 of Section 3.1 Prove that the function $f:\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})  \rightarrow \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$
given by $f(a + b\sqrt{2}) = a - b\sqrt{2}$ is an isomorphism.
\paragraph{Solution}

In order for $f$ to be an isomorphism, it must be a bijective homomorphism.

First, to be bijective, it must be both injective and surjective.
Take $f(a), f(b) \epsilon \mathbb{Q}\sqrt{2}$ such that $f(a) = f(b)$. Then, for some $k,l,m,n \epsilon \mathbb{Q}, f(k+l\sqrt{2}) = f(m + n\sqrt{2})$. This implies that $k-l\sqrt{2} = m - n\sqrt{2}$, by the definition of $f$. We can group the rational and irrational parts together to get $k-l\sqrt{2} = m - n\sqrt{2} \Rightarrow (k-m) = (l-n)\sqrt{2}$. But $(k-m)$ is rational, and $(l-n)\sqrt{2}$ is irrational. The only way this could be possible is if $(k-m)=0$ and $(l-n)=0$, since $(0-0) = (0-0)\sqrt{2}$. This implies that $k=m$ and $l=n$. Therefore, $k+l\sqrt{2} = m + n\sqrt{2}$ and $f$ is an injective function.

Now, consider $c - d\sqrt{2}  \epsilon \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$. $c - d\sqrt{2}$ is mapped to from $c + d\sqrt{2}$, since $(c + d\sqrt{2}) = c - d\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, $f$ is surjective, and as a result of that, bijective.\\

Now, we must prove that $f$ is a homomorphism.
Consider  $f((k+l\sqrt{2}) * (m + n\sqrt{2}))$. This simplifies to $f(km + kn\sqrt{2} + ml\sqrt{2} + nl)$, which again simplifies to $f((km + nl) + (kn + ml)\sqrt{2})$. By applying the function $f$, we get $f((km + nl) + (kn + ml)\sqrt{2}) = (km + nl) - (kn + ml)\sqrt{2}$. Now consider $f(k+l\sqrt{2}) * f(m+n\sqrt{2})$. By appliying $f$, we get $(k -l\sqrt{2}) * (m - n\sqrt{2})$. We  can use distributive laws to get $km - kn\sqrt{2} - ml\sqrt{2} +2nl = (km + 2nl) - (kn + ml)\sqrt{2} = f((k+l\sqrt{2}) * (m + l\sqrt{2}))$. Therefore, $f$ preserves multiplication

Now consider $f((k+l\sqrt{2}) + (m + n\sqrt{2}))$ This simplifies to $f((k+m) + (n+l)\sqrt{2})$.Applying $f$, $f((k+m) + (n+l)\sqrt{2}) = (k+m) - (n+l)\sqrt{2}$.  Next consider $f(k + l\sqrt{2}) + f(m + n\sqrt{2})$. Applying $f$, $f(k + l\sqrt{2}) + f(m + n\sqrt{2}) = (k-l\sqrt{2}) + (m-\sqrt{2}) = (k+m) - (n+l)\sqrt{2}$, by associativity. But $(k+m) - (n+l)\sqrt{2} = f((k+l\sqrt{2}) + (m+n\sqrt{2})$ and therefore $f$ preserves addition.
 Since $f$ preserves addition and multiplication, it is a homomorphism, and since it is a bijective homomorphism, it is an isomorphism.

\section{Section 3.3\# 12e}
\paragraph{Problem} Is the following function a homeomorphism or not?
\begin{equation}
f: \mathbb{Z}_{12} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_4 
\end{equation}
defined by $f([x]_{12}) = [x]_4$, where $[u]_4$ denotes the class of the integer $u$ in $\mathbb{Z}_n$
\paragraph{Solution}
First, we need to prove that this function is well defined. To do this, consider $[a]_{12}$ and $[a+12]_{12}$ such that $a, a+12\ epsilon \mathbb{Z}_{12}$. It is clear that $[a]_{12} = [a+12]_{12}$, since these are equivalence classes in $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$. Now consider $f([a]_{12})$ and $f([a+12]_{12})$. Then applying $f$, $f([a]_{12}) = [a]_4$ and $f([a+12]_{12}) = [a+12]_4$. But $[a+12]_4 = [a]_4 + [12]_4 = [a]_4 + [0]_4 = [a]_4$, since it is an equivalence class. Then $f([a]_{12}) = f([a+12]_{12}) $, and $f$ is well defined.

Now, for $f$ to be a homomorphism, it must preserve addition and multiplication. Consider $f([x]_{12} + [y]_{12})$, $x,y \epsilon \mathbb{Z}_{12}$. Then $f([x]_{12} + [y]_{12}) = f([x+y]_{12}) = [x+y]_{4}$, by the definitions of equivalence classes and $f$. Now consider $f([x]_{12}) + f([y]_{12}) = [x]_4 + [y]_4 = [x+y]_4 = f([x]_{12} + [y]_{12})$, by the same properties of equivalence classes. Since $f([x]_{12} + [y]_{12}) = f([x]_{12}) + f([y]_{12})$, $f$ preserves addition.

 To check if $f$ preserves multiplication, consider $f([x]_{12}*[y]_{12})$. We can use rules of equivalence classes and apply the function $f$ to get $f([x]_{12}*[y]_{12}) = f([xy]_{12}) = [xy]_4$. Now consider $f([x]_{12}) * f([y]_{12})$. By applying $f$, we get $f([x]_{12}) * f([y]_{12}) = [x]_4 * [y]_4 = [xy]_4 = f([x]_{12}*[y]_{12})$, and therefore $f$ preserves multiplication.

Since $f$ is well-defined and preserves multiplication and addition, it is homomorphism.


\section{Section 3.3\#30}
\paragraph{Problem}
Let $f:R\rightarrow S$ be a homomorphism of rings and let $K = \{r\epsilon R | f(r) = 0_S\}$.
Prove that K is a subring of R.
\paragraph{Solution}

Since $f$ is a homomorphism of rings, $0_R \epsilon R$, $0_S \epsilon S$, and $f(0_R) = 0_S$. Therefore, $0_R \epsilon K$, and $K \neq \emptyset$.

Now take $a, b \epsilon K$. By the definition of $K$, $f(a) = 0_S$ and $f(b) = 0_S$. Subtracting one from the other, $f(a) - f(b) = 0_S - 0_S = 0_S$. Since $f$ is a ring homomorphism, it preserves subtraction, and $f(a) - f(b) = f(a - b) = 0_S$. This implies that $a-b \epsilon K$, and therefore $K$ is closed under subtraction.

To proved that $K$ is closed under multiplication, consider the same $a,b$ from above. Then $f(a) * f(b) = 0_S * 0_S = 0_S$. Again, since $f$ is a ring homomorphism, it preserves multiplication and $f(a) * f(b) = f(a*b) = 0_S$. Therefore, $ab \epsilon K$ and $K$ is closed under multiplication. 

Since $K$ is a nonempty subset closed under subtraction and multiplication, it is a subring of $R$.

\section{Section 3.3 \#38}
\paragraph{Problem}
Let $F$ be a field and $f: \rightarrow R$ a homomorphism of rings.
\subparagraph{(a)}
If there is a nonzero element $c$ of $F$ such that $f(c) = 0_R$, prove that $f$ is the zero homomorphism (that is, $f(x) = 0_R$ for every $x \epsilon F$). [Hint: $c^{-1}$ exists (Why?). If $x \epsilon F$, consider $F(xcc^{-1})$.]
\subparagraph{(b)}
Prove that $f$ is either injective of the zero homomorphism. [Hint: If $f$ is not the zero homomorphism and $f(a)= f(b)$, then $f(a-b) = 0_R$.]

\paragraph{Solution}
