\paragraph{Writing complete sentances}
After reading \textit{Some Guidelines on Mathematical Writing} by Francis Edward Su, one way I could improve with my proof writing skills is by using full sentances. By using full sentances, one creates a much more logical flow to one's proof. One is forced to clearly explain what they are doing, which also helps avoid skipping steps in the proof. If I implement this, along with some other suggestions from Su, I will be writing great mathematical proofs in no time.
